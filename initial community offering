We are seeking a solution that allows individuals within a neighbourhood to connect and partner on things that are important and add value to the growth and sustainment of their community.  Beyond a means to host and answer a call for volunteers, this platform would empower individuals to foster a sense of community by easily conecting them to those whin their proximity and proposing impact solutions of any scale.
